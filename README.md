InboxIQ is a web-based MVP designed to simplify college email communication by organizing emails into meaningful categories and highlighting important deadlines.
The system focuses on reducing information overload for students by providing a clean inbox view with filters and automated deadline visibility.

# Features
- Categorized inbox (Academics, Events, Mess, etc.)
- Automated deadline highlighting
- Email preview panel
- Secure authentication using Firebase
- User-specific data handling

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication
- Database: Firebase Firestore

# How It Works
InboxIQ processes structured email data at the frontend and applies filtering and categorization logic before rendering it in the inbox.  
The current MVP uses simulated email data, but the same logic can work with real email sources by changing the data input layer.

# Project Status
This project is a functional MVP developed for a hackathon submission and demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow.

# Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
